# Simple React Kanban Board

A minimal and modern **Kanban board** built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Tasks can be created, dragged between columns, and deleted – all handled with React state and native drag-and-drop events (no external APIs or libraries).

## Features

- Three default columns:
  - **To Do**
  - **In Progress**
  - **Done**
- Add a new task with:
  - Text input
  - Target column selector
- Drag and drop tasks between columns
- Remove tasks with a close button
- Live task count on each column header
- Clean dark UI with gradient headers and subtle hover animations
- Fully client-side, no backend or API calls

## Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite dev server)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **CSS modules (`App.css`)**
